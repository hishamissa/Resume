Updated 2024 Resume. Created/developed using LaTex. 

I will update the resume as I add/change things on it. This purpose of this project was to both uproot and improve my old resume, and get experience in the language of LaTex. At first I found it complicated and tedious, but after working on this for a bit I know find making changes and updates to the resume far easier and I feel I have more control over the layout and design of the entire page using LaTex as opposed to something like Word or Google Docs. 

Resume.PDF contains the fully compiled and rendered version.
